# DOPP Butterfly Wing Shapes

In this exercise we were tasked to re-analyse data from the paper [1] which have made the data on which their analysis is based publicly available [ 2 ].

Numpy, Pandas and Scipy where not allowed in this task and the main goal was to preprocess the data which was only avaliable as .xlsx files.
The xlrd package is used to load data from Excel files.
